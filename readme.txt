Create easily adjustable pricing tables with up to 3 tiers for displaying pricing plans.

== Description ==

Create easily adjustable pricing tables with up to 3 tiers for displaying pricing plans.
The block was developed specifically for the Twenty Twenty-Five theme.

== Installation ==

1. Download the ZIP file. Then, from the WordPress admin, navigate to Plugins > Add Plugin > Upload Plugin and choose the downloaded ZIP file.
2. Alternatively, clone the repository to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin.

== Usage ==

On a post or page, navigate to Add Block and choose the 'WCAG Compliant Pricing Tables' Block.
By default, two pricing tiers will be added, but from the Block Controls you can add a third tier.
In each tier, the user can add the following content:

- Plan Name
- Price
- Featured Table (toggle control)
- Features (repeater fields with sorting, duplicate & delete, and also an Excluded toggle control)
 -Button text
- Button URL
- Sorting (Move Tier Up or Down)
- Rich Text can be directly edited and entered inside the block for the description
- The block toolbar has an alignment option, and for 3 tiers, it is better to use Wide width.

== Assumptions ==
Design/UX choices (e.g., default tier count, layout
approach).

== Considerations ==
Notes on accessibility, code structure, and optional
enhancements.

== Changelog ==
